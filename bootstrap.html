      <h3><mark>Dr. Emily Carter</mark></h3>
      <p>Her passion for physical therapy began after sustaining a severe knee injury in college, which introduced her to the challenges of recovery firsthand. Determined to bridge the gap between therapy and fitness, she pursued a Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) and worked in leading sports rehabilitation clinics before co-founding HealFit. Dr. Carter is the driving force behind the company’s evidence-based approach, ensuring all programs are grounded in the latest research and clinical expertise.
